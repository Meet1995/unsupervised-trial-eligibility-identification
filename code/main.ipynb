CXR : New right picc line with tip in proximal svc . Intraperitoneal air remains , possibly with slight increase vs redistribution . Minimal retrocardiac opacity c/w atelectasis however minimal infectious vs inflammatory process can not be excluded. . CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS : Visualized portions of the lung bases are unchanged from the previous study . There is no pleural or pericardial effusion . Coronary arterial calcification is also noted . A moderate-sized pneumoperitoneum is enlarged since . A small amount of free-fluid is also seen , predominantly in a perihepatic location as well as a second collection at the base of the mesentery ( 2:49 ) . The unenhanced liver , spleen , pancreas , adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable . Note is made of a gallstone within an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder , unchanged . Atherosclerotic calcification is noted along the abdominal aorta and its arterial branches and note is also made of aortic ectasia . Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are visualized , none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement . The previously described area of thickening along the sigmoid colon in the area of known diverticulosis is again visualized , and there is also extraluminal leak of oral contrast .

The patient was considered a high-risk operative candidate due to her cardiac and cancer history , and her pain was focal and isolated to her right lower quadrent , and thus initially received conservative treatment . CT of abdomen/pelvis at time of admission had showed small amount of pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around the liver . Small pelvic free fluid also tracking up along the right paracolic gutter . Extensive colonic diverticulosis , with mild stranding surrounding a loop of sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid diverticulitis as possible source for perforation . She was started on Zosyn early on in her hospital course . Though she initially responded quite well to the IV antibiotics with significant improvement in her abdominal pain for the first days , he patient 's abdominal pain &amp; overall appearance worsened on hospital day # 4 , and it was clear that she needed to be taken to the operating room for a exploratory laparotomy . Repeat imaging confirmed perforated sigmoid diverticulum . She was given FFP , Vitamoin K to correct her INR of 8 , and 1 unit of PRBC and taken to the operating room . the surgical team found a thickened indurated colon but no masses . There was an extensive area of inflammatory changes with a small area of focal perforation along sigmoid colon . There was contained stool in the pelvis . \n","<span style=\"font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; position: relative; height: 60px;\">\n","    She underwent surgery for a perforated diverticulum including a sigmoidectomy , hartmann ? ? ? ? ?\n","    \n","<span style=\"background: #85C1E9; top: 40px; height: 4px; left: -1px; width: calc(100% + 2px); position: absolute;\">\n","</span>\n","\n","    \n","<span style=\"background: #85C1E9; top: 40px; height: 4px; border-top-left-radius: 3px; border-bottom-left-radius: 3px; left: -1px; width: calc(100% + 2px); position: absolute;\">\n","    <span style=\"background: #85C1E9; z-index: 10; color: #000; top: -0.5em; padding: 2px 3px; position: absolute; font-size: 0.6em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 3px\">\n","        st-eng:49 Patients undergoing...for appendicitis\n","    </span>\n","</span>\n","\n","\n","</span>\n","? s pouch , and colostomy with a plan for anastamosis in the future . Her operative course was relatively uncomplicated , she did have some intra-op bleeding which was managed with cautery and FFP . Her post-op course was later complicated by fever after being taken off Zosyn ( her zosyn was continued post operatively for PNA treatment ) . On CT of the abdomen she was found to have loculated fluid collections which required post-operative IR drainage and a JP drain was left in place . She then had to go for repeat IR drainage to help break up the loculations . For enteric broad coverage she was started on Zosyn , Vancomycin , Caspofungin , and Gentamicin and her abdominal fluid grew pseudomonas which was fortunately sensitive to multiple agents . As she continued to recover steadily she was gradually taken off of Vancomycin , Caspofungin and Gentamicin but continued on Zosyn. . A repeat CT was done on to assess interval changes and it appeared that there was continued decrease in size of the left flank and pelvic collections , Hartmann pouch showed no evidence of leak , and she also had complete resolution of bilateral mild hydronephrosis . After this reassuring CT study the surgical team removed her one remaining JP drain on her left abdomen . Colostomy site and prior JP entry site were clean , dry , non-edematous , non-erythematous and in tact at time of discharge . She was set-up with home line care services for her PICC line and she was also set up for additional home VNA services at time of discharge . She had no signs of fevers , abdominal pains , leukocytosis or discomfort for several days leading up to her discharge date . She was instructed to continue her daily Zosyn coverage up until her follow up surgery outpatient appointment at the end of with Dr. . A repeat CT was set-up a few days prior to this appointment to allow for final review for any recurrent abscesses or collections prior to final removal of PICC and antibiotic discontinuance. . # History of AML : The patient 's hematologic/oncology history dates back to fall after routine labs indicated persistent pancytopenia . She had an initial bone marrow biopsy with myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities and additional workup that was most consistent with MDS . A vitamin B12 deficiency was also diagnosed during her initial Heme/Oncology work-up . A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia and she was diagnosed with AML . She was admitted for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and idarubicin , which she tolerated well . She underwent allogeneic transplantation from an HLA matched sibling donor with pentostatin/TBI in . She had additional note of subsequent mild GVHD , predominantly over her skin and mouth . At time of this current admission she had been doing well from an oncologic standpoint and she was on 3mg daily Prednisone , and a prophylactic dose of acyclovir 400mg PO TID . During this admission she was given her inhaled pentamidine on . Upon discharge , Mrs. was set up for close follow-up appointment with Dr. , her primary oncologist. . # Anemia : The patient developed anemia while in the hospital but it remained stable . Iron studies showed that she was not iron deficient . As aforementioned she had a vitamin B12 deficiency recognized back in during her initial referral visits to the hematology/oncology service for pancytopenia . Her B12 shot was given on during this hospital stay . She did require blood transfusions during her hospitalization both peri-operatively and after her IR drainage . She tolerated these very well with no significant reactions of note . Hematocrit at admission was 43 and she had nadir to 25-27 range and by time of discharge her hematocrit was back to 31-33 range consistently and she had no signs of any active bleeding. . # Hypoxia : Post operatively Mrs. became hypoxic with an oxygen requirement . She was found to have a positive RSV respiratory study . A CT from showed new focal opacities in the RUL . She also had diffuse acute dilatation of the airways with mucoid impaction and bronchial wall thickening bilaterally . She had slightly increased pleural effusions and her ground-glass opacity has mostly resolved . Her oxygen requirement resolved on . Per surgical team notes she ahd been placed on Zosyn prior to her surgery and after being diagnosed with probable RUL PNA her therapy was prolonged per ID recommendations , particularly given her additional abdominal collections ( alongside Gentamicin ) . She was placed on albuterol nebulizers and inhalers which she continued to use with decreasing frequency as her breathing came back to baseline . Blood cultures during her hospitalization were all negative . Given her PMH of mild asthma she was discharged to continue her usual home albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis and to notify her doctor if she had any additional fevers , productive cough or recurrent dyspnea. . # Coronary Artery Disease : Mrs. had history of CAD with prior inferior STEMI in for which she underwent RCA stenting , and later had an endoscopic CABG x1 . She was continued on her usual Plavix , aspirin , and atorvastatin therapy . She was set up for follow up appointment with Dr. after discharge. . # Hypertension : Metoprolol dose was decreased to metoprolol tartrate 12.5 as her blood pressure well controlled on this regimen and she was bradycardic at night when on a higher dose . Normotensive at time of discharge. . # Atrial fibrillation : Mrs. and post-operative course were complicated by atrial fibrillation . Before her laparotomy , she was evaluated by cardiology and her coumadin therapy she had been taking for her known atrial fibrillation was discontinued for the procedure . She had some rapid bouts of atrial fibrillation on which required a diltiazem drip for control . On she was taken to the O.R . with no significant cardiac events . Post-surgery she was monitored with serial EKGs , and continuous telemetry and she was eventually converted back to NSR with Amiodarone therapy . She was restarted on warfarin after her surgery and she continued metoprolol . After discussion with Dr. her warfarin was discontinued and she had her dose of Amiodarone tapered prior to discharge . She will see discuss length of her treatment and further dose adjustments at her upcoming cardiology follow-up appointment . She was discharged on 400mg Amiodarone . . # Hypotension : She experienced hypotension preoperatively that required fluid boluses . She also experienced hypotension post operatively that was asymptomatic . Post operatively her hypotensive episodes were attributed to the combination of getting metoprolol and lasix per the surgical service notes . By the time she was transferred to the BMT service on post-operative day nine she was predominantly normotensive and she remained stable for the remainder of her hospital stay. . # Edema : The patient had extensive lower extremity edema and less prominent upper extremity edema post-operatively . She was diuresed aggressively with lasix . She then auto-diuresed for several days without the use of lasix . By the time of her transfer to the BMT service her swelling was minimal although still present . She ws seen by the physical therapy team and was able to ambulate and do some minimal exercises which markedly helped with her conditioning and edema collections . By time of discharge she was near to her usual baseline and she was not placed on any additional diuretics at discharge. . # GERD : She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux and she was continued on her usual famotidine medication for GI protection and relief during her stay. . # Diabetes Mellitus Type II : ? ? ? ? ? ? Mrs . 2 is normally exercise and diet controlled . She was placed on an additional insulin sliding scale for tight control in the peri-operative setting and while in the hospital . She had well controlled fasting and prandial fingersticks which required minimal to no SSI coverage . At time of discharge , she was therefore not placed on any additional agents. . # Insomnia : She had some mild complaints of occasional insomnia during her hospital course which was effectively relieved with lorazepam 0.5 mg PO HS : PRN. . # Nutrition /electrolytes : She required TPN post-operatively but was then transitioned to a regular diabetic diet which she tolerated very well . No issues with colostomy training and care . Nutrition helped with initial electrolyte balance and she was repleted as needed during her stay with close daily monitoring of all of her electrolytes. . # Elevated LFTs : Mrs. had some transaminitis noted during her hospital course which was thought to be secondary to her antibiotics . Once she was tapered down to just Zosyn she seemed to have a resolution of these abnormal labs . At the time of discharge her LFTs were back to normal ranges with AST 39 , ALT 33 , ALP 82 , LDH 199 , and total bilirubin 0.4. . # Code Status : The patient was maintained as a full code status for the entirety of her hospital course .
