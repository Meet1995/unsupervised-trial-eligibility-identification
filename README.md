# An Unsupervised Approach For Identifying Patient Trial Eligibility

This GitHub project provides an algorithm for identifying eligible patients for clinical trials by analyzing patient records and comparing them to trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. The algorithm uses various string similarity functions, including clinical BERT, TFIDF cosine similarity, fuzzy string match, UMLS similarity, and sentence transformer embedding cosine similarity. The project includes code for preparing & processing patient records and trial criteria, as well as implementing the matching algorithm.
